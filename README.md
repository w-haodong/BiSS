# BiSS-Net: Bi-Scope Contextual State-Space Learning for Automated Cobb Angle Measurement in Full-Body X-rays

Abstract: Manual Cobb angle measurement for scoliosis assessment from X-rays is subjective and timeconsuming. While automated methods have advanced significantly, achieving consistently high accuracy and robustness in landmark localization, especially for challenging full-body radiographs containing diverse anatomical structures and potential occlusions, remains an area for improvement. This paper introduces BiSS-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed for precise vertebral landmark detection to automate Cobb angle calculation. BiSS-Net effectively integrates efficient global context modeling using State Space Model (SSM) with a novel Bi-Scope Contextual Module (BCM). The BCM captures both fine-grained local and broader regional spinal features, yielding robust representations that balance detail and structure. Tested on the standard AASCE 2019 benchmark and a challenging custom Full-Body dataset, BiSS-Net significantly outperforms stateof-the-art approaches across multiple accuracy metrics while maintaining computational efficiency. Ablation studies validate the contributions of both the integrated SSM blocks and the proposed BCM. Our results demonstrate the high potential of the BiSS-Net architecture, combining advanced SSM with targeted contextual modules, for robust landmark detection in complex medical imaging tasks.
